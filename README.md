# Logitech-G-Hub-Modifier-Macros
Create macros for function+modifier key combos

Just add the lua script to your Logitech G Hub Profile and create macros for the desired key stroke with the following convention,

You can create a macro for any combination of the following keys;

 - F1-F12
 - CTRL
 - SHIFT
 - ALT

The naming convention requires you to put the modifier keys in order starting from ctrl, then shift and finishing with alt. Joining each key with a "**+**" and adding the function key name at the end.

If you wanted to create a macro for `CTRL`+`ALT`+`SHIFT`+`F1` then the name should be `"ctrl+shift+alt+f1"`.
